# 100 days of Data Science
## Learning the Fundamentals of Data Science

The motivation behind such a challenge is to really work at learning data science in a meaningful way. Hopefully, people will be able to use this repository in due time to start on their data science journey. 

A time slot of 3 hours per day is allocated to this challenge, that's 300 hours. The idea is to use this time as efficiently as possible. 

From what I gather, there are three fundamental aspects to data science:
- Statistics (Probabilistic Modelling, story telling with data, etc)
- Coding (My Language of choice will by Python)
- Computer Science knowledge like Algorithms, Data Structures etc

__This is the Roadmap:__
- [ ] [MIT Statistics Course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-443-statistics-for-applications-spring-2015/)
- [ ] [Google Data Analytics Course](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics)
- [ ] [Data Science with Python Track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python)
- [ ] Azure Certification, specifically Azure Fundamentals

Everything that I do, be it taking notes, cleaning a new data set or even learning something basic, I'll be writing it all here.
